# TravelTrucks - Front - APP

## Project Overview

This project is created for **TravelTrucks**, a company that offers camper
rental services. The web application includes several pages, such as:

- Home page
- Camper catalog
- Individual camper page with reviews and a booking form

To interact with camper listings, the frontend application utilizes a backend
API, which is available at:

[https://66b1f8e71ca8ad33d4f5f63e.mockapi.io/campers](https://66b1f8e71ca8ad33d4f5f63e.mockapi.io/campers)

### Main API Endpoints:

- `GET /campers` – Fetch all listings (with optional filtering parameters)
- `GET /campers/:id` – Fetch details of a specific listing by its ID

## Technology Stack

- **React** – for building the user interface
- **Vite** – as the project bundler and local server
- **ESLint** – for code quality checks
